/*

You should start by getting a sense for how average player salaries have changed over
time. In 1.sql, write a SQL query to find the average player salary by year.

Sort by year in descending order.
Round the salary to two decimal places and call the column “average salary”.
Your query should return a table with two columns, one for year and one for average
 salary.
