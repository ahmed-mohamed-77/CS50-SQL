Users need to be prevented from re-opening a message that has expired. Find when the message with ID 151 expires. You may use the messageâ€™s ID directly in your query.

Ensure your query uses the index automatically created on the primary key column of the messages table.

SELECT * FROM messages
WHERE id = 151;
