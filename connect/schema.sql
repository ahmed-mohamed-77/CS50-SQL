Users
The heart of LinkedIn’s platform is its people. Your database should be able to represent the following information about LinkedIn’s users:

Their first and last name
Their username
Their password
Keep in mind that, if a company is following best practices, application passwords are “hashed.” No need to worry about hashing passwords here, though.
